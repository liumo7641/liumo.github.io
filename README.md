## About Me & Research Interests

My research lies at Microeconomic Theory and Policy Economics. I am driven by a desire to not only evaluate if a policy works empirically but to understand why it is designed that way and how its theoretical properties drive outcomes.

**Primary Research Interests:**
* **Mechanism Design & Matching Theory:** Stability, strategy-proofness, and market design.
* **Applied Microeconomic Theory:** Auction theory and public policy modeling.
* **Economics of Education:** Teacher evaluation metrics and school choice systems.

## Writing Samples & Research Projects

Below are selected research papers and course projects demonstrating my work in both theoretical modeling and empirical analysis.

### 1. College-Major Choice in the Gaokao Mechanism
* [cite_start]**Type:** Advanced Microeconomic Analysis Course Project [cite: 44]
* [cite_start]**Summary:** This paper analyzes the Chinese *Gaokao* system by formulating a three-sided matching model (students, colleges, majors)[cite: 46]. [cite_start]I demonstrate that while a two-phase deferred acceptance algorithm can yield stable outcomes under separable preferences, specific conditions—such as restricted proposals and intra-group adjustments—can introduce instability and reduce strategy-proofness[cite: 47, 48].

### 2. Measuring Teacher Effect Using CEPS Data
* [cite_start]**Type:** Economics of Education Course Project [cite: 50]
* [cite_start]**Summary:** Using data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), this empirical study estimates teacher value-added effects on student performance[cite: 52]. [cite_start]By applying fixed-effects panel models to address endogeneity from non-random teacher assignments, I find that teacher quality differences account for 0.12–0.13 standard deviations in student test scores[cite: 53].

### 3. Analysis of Shenzhen Car Plates Allocation Mechanism
* [cite_start]**Type:** Undergraduate Thesis [cite: 55]
* **Summary:** This paper investigates Shenzhen's hybrid lottery-auction system for car license plates. [cite_start]I established a Game Theory model based on private values to derive the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium for bidders[cite: 57]. [cite_start]The study evaluates the mechanism's equity (via Gini Coefficient) and efficiency (social surplus) and utilizes machine learning methods to forecast minimum auction prices[cite: 58, 59].
